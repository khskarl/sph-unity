# Smoothed particle hydrodynamics in Unity
An incomplete *Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics* (SPH) implementation in the *Unity* game engine. 

This project's objective was to experiment implementing a fluid simulation for the first time using SPH. 
This code is a badly planned mess, it lacks surface tension forces, it's hard to pick good parameters and incompressibility isn't guaranteed.

Unity engine was chosen for no special reason other than having past experience with it and being fast to get started. 
Due to limitations and feeling that I have learnt enough, I concluded it would be wiser to remake it from the ground up outside of unity.

## TODO
- [ ] Add gifs to this README
- [ ] Fluid like renderer
